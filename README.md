# Machine-Learning-solution-for-Robot-Navigation (Python based project)
This projects involves the implementation of Machine Learning solution to help robot navigation through identification of ground terrain.
# Project Description
1. The project aims at implementing a Machine Learning solution to help robots identify their ground terrain.
2. The inputs are obtained from IMU and the output is one of possible 9 surface types (classification problem).
# Scope
1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Implementing ML models for classifications
4. Optimization.
